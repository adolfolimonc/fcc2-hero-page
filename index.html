                <h2>They Told Me I Was Good at Design</h2><br>
                <p>I’m not particularly “artistic”. How’s that? I fell in love with coding during my technical degree on IT. I used to code in Visual Basic 6  —because of the curriculum, but I’m a rebel, so I switched to Visual Basic .NET. I did what many years later I knew was called UI design. I was particularly praised to be “highly organised” with information. Every “label, “textbox” was on its place, it looked harmonious, aesthetical and intuitive, which led my teachers to tell me “you’re good at design”. Me? An insensitive guy indifferent to the arts?</p>

                <h2>Something failed</h2><br>
                <p>Long-story short, a project I worked for in my last year as a student failed horribly, and I couldn’t process it. Coming from a broken but happy family background, and lacking the determination that today I proudly hold, I didn’t know how to take failure. I was the smart perfect kid whose future was going to be brilliant. But that perception ended in one failed presentation. I left IT, and my self-esteem.</p>

                <p>I wandered professionally, and I gave myself a second chance with IT, but failed again… miserably. I abandoned IT forever. I got my teachers’ words in my mind… “you’re good at design!”. Me? An insensitive guy? Me who thinks arts is bs? I don’t think so.</p>

                <p>I kept checking on design tendencies for a long time, and without even realising, I ended up installing Adobe Photoshop on my PC. Years went by, and I wasn’t really good enough in code nor design. I was lost, depressed and resigned that I wasn’t good for anything.</p>

                <h2>Stop stalking me!</h2><br>
                <p>“Starting The Branding Process – Building A Brand, Episode 1” I read on YouTube. 100th time I saw the title on the recommended section, actually. One lazy day I clicked it. It started with a phrase that shaped my focus “What does it take to start a business”. I, who is also very interested in business, had never thought of that question. It was a series of the YouTube Channel TheFutur. I and my broken English prepared to watch the video that was about to change my professional life. I could see two charismatic people: Matthew Encina and Ben Burns crafting a beautiful craft beer brand, and once the video was finished, I said: "I want to do that".</p>

                <h2>Healthy obsession</h2><br>
                <p>I was making good money waitering back then. With decent savings, and a stroke of luck in the stock market, I took a whole year to learn full-time about design using every existing TheFutur’s material. First I thought Matthew Encina and Ben Burns were the creators, but after diving in a bit, I found the name Chris Do, who later became my hero.</p>

                <h2>I’m a strategist! Aren’t I?</h2><br>
                <p>His teachings led me to think that it’s not necessary to be artistic or sensitive, if you have a process and a strategic mindset. And I solved one cognitive dissonance I was carrying on my shoulders for years: I can’t be a designer if I’m not artistic. I opted for strategy and he suggests, and it was a game-changer mindset for me.</p>

                <p>I had a mild success being a freelance designer thanks to all his and my efforts. Then the idea of gooing back to IT after recovering my self-esteem was tattoed on my mind, and here I am… coding a web page honouring and thanking him for his endevours to help 1 billion people make a living doing what they love, and I proudly say I’m one in a billion.</p>

I’m attempting to change my career, and with all the knowledge I’ve learnt from Chris Do and TheFutur throgh their courses, YouTube Channels, podcasts, books and the question “what would Chris "Do"  in my position?”, I’m excited to see what’s coming.</p>
